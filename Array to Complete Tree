Dependents on how the array in our design.

If we use the array only to save the value of node, then 
for node i, 
the parent of the node will be (i-1)/2, 
the children of the node will be: left: 2i+1; right 2i+2

If we use the array[0] to store the number of the element in the array, then
for node i,
the parent of the node will be i/2
the children of the node will be : left: 2i; right: 2i+1
