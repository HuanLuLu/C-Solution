Method 1:
finding the common prefix. Shift left and right until they are equal.

int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right){
	int shift = 0;
	while (right > left) {
		right = right >> 1;
		left = left >> 1;
		shift++;
	}
	return right<<shift;
}

Method 2:
Since we know n & (n-1) will set the most left siginificant one to zero. We can keep doing it until right < left



int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right){
	while (right > left) {
		right = right & (right - 1);
	}
	return right;
}
