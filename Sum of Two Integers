Notice that since left shift on signed number is undefined. We need to avoid that. Simplis way is using unsigned number

int getSum(int a, int b){
	unsigned int temp;
	unsigned int aa = (unsigned int) a;
	unsigned int bb = (unsigned int) b;

	while(bb != 0) {
		temp = aa ^ bb;
		bb = (aa & bb) << 1;
		aa = temp;
	}
	return (int)(aa);
}
