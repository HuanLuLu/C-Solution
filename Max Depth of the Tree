The depth: consider the tree as a root, the depth of the root node of the tree will be 0
The height: consider the tree as a tree, the height of the leaf node of the tree will be 0

Please note that, when reach the leaf, the function will return -1

int maxDepth(treeNode *node){
    if (node == NULL) {return -1;}
    
    int left = maxDepth(node->left);
    int right = maxDepth(node->right);
    
    return (left > right) ? (left + 1) : (right + 1);
}
